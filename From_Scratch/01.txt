Tokens are used to identify and classify different types of lexemes (lexical units) in the input text.

The resulting integer value is assigned to the yylval variable. This allows the parser to access the numerical value associated with the NUM token.
The parser can then retrieve the actual numerical value from yylval when it encounters the NUM token during parsing.
